        Ooty is a scenic hill town in southern India. It is surrounded by the
        Nilgiri Hills and is popularly known as the Queen of Hills. Climate (if
        any) is the only serious deterrent which might spoil your travel plans
        to Ooty. But regarding climate too, Ooty has something different to
        offer all throughout the year. The summer is perhaps the best time to
        visit the place, if you are planning to visit all the tourist spots,
        including some adventurous treks and hand gliding.
